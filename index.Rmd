## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor of Public Health at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I am co-director of the Laboratory of Physical Activity, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (LADD) at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. My research group has been working on health technology assessment and research synthesis. We have been using methodological studies, systematic reviews and clinical trials. All of these projects are designed to serve as platforms of academic education and scientific excellence, being based on practices to promote an open, public-centred, and inclusive science.

## Projects

Below are brief descriptions and links for some projects I've worked on.

*Ongoing*

[Trial Outcomes - Kids] (https://osf.io/3zcfn/) \| An umbrella review to summarize outcomes measured in trials with physical activity interventions for children and adolescents.

[The Data Percept](https://osf.io/gw2x6/) \| This project surveys perceptions and practices on research data management within our institution.

[PNS Studies](https://osf.io/gw2x6/) \| This project explores data and studies from the "Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde" (PNS-Brasil) focusing social determinants of health.

[Diabetes Estimates](https://osf.io/gw2x6/) \| This project used secondary data to estimate the potential prevention of physical activity against diabetes-related complications.

*Completed (non-exhaustive)*

[The BENEFIT-CA Trial](https://osf.io/gw2x6/) \| A trial to assess the feasibility of a home-based exercise program for individuals with breast or prostate cancer.
